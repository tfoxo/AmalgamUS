This is a general release of FontForge sfd files that can be used to generate the Amalgam-xx font-family.

When time for review is available, we'll provide TTF/OTF versions over on the old DeviantArt page that the font was originally released on, or elsewhere, unless we come up with an alternative method of tracking exclusive downloads.  Bare in mind, this glyph-set is for personal use, not intended for third-party public distribution, with exception to the D. A. source page.

## FILE-VERSIONS

This is an initial pre-lease — file names are expected to change to `amalgam-[unique].[ext]`

The glyph-sets vary for some of these versions.

`AmalgamR_ex.sfd` --- As close to the original typeface as possible.

`AmalgamWFX.sfd` --- (possibly) CDC's Initial glyph-set revision, including thw WipeOUT inspired star replacing the `R` (registered trademark) symbol.  This set contains some lower-case characters, and several other glyphs such as the new `&` symbol.

`AmalgamWOX.sfd` --- A WipeOUT inspired rendition of the typeface including a complete lower-case character-set for the lower case mapping.

`AmalgamXtra.sfd` --- Additional glyphs or symbols common to the family or not included; EG: WIP.

This typeface is considered copyright of "Designers Republic(TM)".

Some addition of design has been implemented on the prior-art in attempt to re-create the visual experience provided by the original work, which we may only assume was originally a bitmap-font usually put to use on something along the terms of 300 to 600dpi resolution on compact-disk, cassette and vinyl sleeves including perhaps other promotional mediums.

private use.  We do not recommend incorporating this font for commercial or corporate usage, as it has been used in PWEI products and within the game series, WipeOUT from SCE (Sony Computer Entertainment).
