This is a general release of FontForge sfd files that can be used to generate the Amalgam-xx font-family.

When time for review is available, we'll provide TTF/OTF versions over on the old DeviantArt page that the font was originally released on, or elsewhere, unless we come up with an alternative method of tracking downloads.

## FILE-VERSIONS

This is an initial pre-lease.

The glyph-sets vary for some of these versions.

`AmalgamR_ex.sfd` --- As close to the original typeface as possible.

`AmalgamWFX.sfd` --- (possibly) camron's Initial glyph-set revision, including thw WipeOUT inspired star replacing the `R` (registered trademark) symbol.  This set contains some lower-case characters, and several other glyphs such as the new `&` symbol.

`AmalgamWOX.sfd` --- A WipeOUT inspired rendition of the typeface including a complete lower-case character-set for the lower case mapping.

`AmalgamXtra.sfd` --- Additional glyphs or symbols common to the family or not included; EG: WIP.

## HISTORICAL

This font was designed by and for PWEI fans as well as fans of Wip3OUT products.
In attempt to produce an honorable 'emulation' of a existing product, we are introduced with a question of how to balance respect/honor between fans and the original artist.  It is this reason that many entities (such as myself) have either remained anonymous, or allowed a 'tainted' emulation of such products to remain in the public domain.

Historically, there used to be countless resources on line to use as references up until around 2010, at which time most of such resources disappeared from the www, including full-spirited PWEI-NATION, PWSI (Pop Will Sample Itself) and PWEI-product presence.

Once upon a time, PWEI-NATION (or similarly named fan page) actually contained the most accurate form of this font as seen publicly in the form of a bitmap image (or some digital/pixel format).  For reasons unknown to me, the font disappeared from the public domain shortly thereafter.  (wishing I had that bitmap)

I had at a given time collected many of the resources I had found in the past, to lose them in several hard-disk crashes ;(

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NOTE

This typeface is considered copyright of "Designers Republic(TM)".

Some addition of design has been implemented on the prior-art in attempt to re-create the visual experience provided by the original work, which we may only assume was originally a bitmap-font usually put to use on something along the terms of 300 to 600dpi resolution on compact-disk, cassette and vinyl sleeves including perhaps other promotional mediums.

Downloading this font limits you to private use.  We do not recommend incorporating this font for commercial or corporate usage, as it has been used in PWEI products and within the game series, WipeOUT from SCE (Sony Computer Entertainment).
